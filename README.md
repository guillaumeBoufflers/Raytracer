Raytracer
=========

An advanced image generator using Raytracing and Pathtracing.

The raytracer was one of the final project of the first year.

To simplify this ReadMe, you can easily understand the concept of raytracing here : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)

So, we made a raytracer but also a pathtracer ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_tracing ) , which is a more realistic version of ray tracing

You can lauch a render, with this syntax : ./rt scene/pt/file

The rendering can be very long, but the value "per pixel" in rt.h is not high, if you want a better quality, increase this value and recompile the project !
